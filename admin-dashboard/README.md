# CSS and HTML Admin Dashboard
I created a lovely Admin Dashboard using HTML & CSS only. This project is designed to showcase how to create a structured dashboard interface without using JavaScript or external libraries.

# Key features
- Stylish, pink colour scheme 
- CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts for responsive design

# Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)

# Credits
- My design was inspired by The Odin Project's Admin Dashboard project.
- Icons were taken from Material icons
## Icon Credit
- The "Cute Dog" icon used in this project is created by [IconArchive](https://www.iconarchive.com/show/cute-animal-icons-by-iconarchive/Cute-Dog-icon.html) and is part of the "Cute Animal Icons" collection.
