# Admin Dashboard

I created an Admin Dashboard using HTML & CSS only. The template was provided by **The Odin Project**. This project is designed to showcase how to create a structured dashboard interface without using JavaScript or external libraries.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)

## What I learned

- Practised CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive positioning.
- Learned how to design a functional sidebar and navigation layout.  
- Enhanced my ability to plan and structure HTML for complex pages.
